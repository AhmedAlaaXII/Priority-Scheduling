# Priority-Scheduling
Priority Scheduling , Small Simulation To The Algorithm using JAVA
## Explanation of the algorithm and the code
- Priority scheduling is most commom algorithm in CPU scheduling 
- Priority scheduling give priority to the process that have high priority (less priority number)
- the code handle almost all cases 
- the first input are number of processes and the context switching value (that`s Fixed Value , the time that the CPU to take to switch to other process)
- the other n (number of processes) input line are
- the process name , arrival time , burst time (execution time) and its priority
- the first output is the processes execution order (appear process name and the time that`s ended at)
- the second output is the each process Name , WaitingTime ,TurnaroundTime and BurstTime
- WaitingTime (all time once it arrival to once it's finished except the execution time)
- TurnaroundTime (all time once it arrival to once it's finished include the execution time)
- and finally last two output are the avrage WaitingTime and avrage TurnaroundTime
